## ibbdatascraper.py Script Overview

This script downloads an XML file from a web IBB (Istanbul Büyükşehir Belediyesi) API service  that provides camera information, parses the XML data using ElementTree, extracts specific camera attributes, and stores the data in a pandas DataFrame. The extracted attributes include the camera's group ID, ID, images, name, video URLs, coordinates, and group. The DataFrame is then printed to the console and saved as a CSV file named kamera.csv. Finally, the downloaded XML file is removed.
